# YourFit

Submission for 2024 Congressional App Challenge
We never managed to finish this app since we dont know flutter so we have decided to open source it so feel free to contribute! The code is messy and the features arent really functioning at all so if anyone actually wants to make this happen itll be cool.

Requires a mistral api key and a groq api key.
The database that the ai is trained on will be found in the AIDATA directory
