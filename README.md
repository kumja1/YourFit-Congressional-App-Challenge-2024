# YourFit
AI fitness app 
Submission for 2024 Congressional App Challenge
We never managed to finish this app due to various challenges we encountered along the way(and it was our first time using flutter) so we have decided to open source it so feel free to contribute! The code is messy and the features arent really functioning at all so if anyone actually wants to make this happen itll be cool.

## How to build 
```flutter build apk```

## Other info

The dataset that the AI was trained on can be found in ```assets/data.csv.gz```

  * [Groq api key](https://console.groq.com/)
### Both are free services but you can pay for less rate limiting and other features
