# YourFit
AI fitness app 
Submission for 2024 Congressional App Challenge
We never managed to finish this app since we dont know flutter so we have decided to open source it so feel free to contribute! The code is messy and the features arent really functioning at all so if anyone actually wants to make this happen itll be cool.

## How to build 
```flutter build apk```

## Other info
Requires a mistral api key and a groq api key.
The database that the ai is trained on will be found in the /AIDATA directory (still waiting for it, it likelyisnt needed for testing at the moment, its just its training data.
